# 1. Business Problem

### Description

---

**Rossmann** is a real German drugstore which is available in many European countries. Their business model is the sale of products such as medicines, baby and body care, hygiene, sun protections, cosmetics, dental hygiene, household, pets, hair care, perfume, fragrances, and food products. 

**Purpose:** to forecast sales revenue of the next 6 weeks for Rossmann stores to know if we will be able to make a renovation for every store. (Fictitious purpose)

**Strategy:** we used the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Process - Data Science) as the main project management methodology. The predictions were delivered through a Telegram Bot in order the CFO and stakeholders check the informations using their smartphones. 

The dataset used in this project contains historical drugstore sales from 1115 Rossmann stores (Europe). Dataset description and all files may be checked and downloaded through [Kaggle - Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data).   

All files from the dataset were uploaded on [datasets](https://github.com/lucasquemelli/Rossmann_Store_Sales/tree/main/datasets) folder. However, the **train** file could not be uploaded on GitHub due to its size exceeds 25 MB. Therefore, we decided to load data from local repository for this project.
