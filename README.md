# 1. Business Problems 

#### Description

---

**Rossmann** is a real German drugstore whose business model is the sale of products such as medicines, baby and body care, hygiene, sun protections, cosmetics, dental hygiene, household, pets, hair care, perfume, fragrances, and food products. 

**Purpose:** to forecast sales revenue of the next 6 weeks for Rossmann stores to know if we will be able to make a renovation for every store. 

**Strategy:** we used the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Process - Data Science) as the main project management methodology. The predictions were delivered through a Telegram Bot in order the CFO and stakeholders check the informations using their smartphones.
